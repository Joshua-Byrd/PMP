# PMP

PMP is a simple calculator for pool operators.  It prompts the user for the results of their daily test results, then caculates the amount and type of chemicals to add to effect the desired change in chemistry.  This is my first program from scratch so it needs a lot of work. Still, it's mostly functional at this point, although I'm working on a function to export the tests as a csv file. Eventually, I'd like to remake it as an app that an operator could store on his/her phone for easy use.
