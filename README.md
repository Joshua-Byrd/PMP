# PMP

PMP is a simple calculator for pool operators.  It prompts the user for the results of their daily test results, then caculates the amount and type of chemicals to add to effect the desired change in chemistry.  It is mostly functional at this point, although I'm working on a function to export the tests as a csv file.

The print_table function is not displaying the table neatly.
